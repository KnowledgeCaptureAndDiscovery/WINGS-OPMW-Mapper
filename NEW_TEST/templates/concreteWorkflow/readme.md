##MPileupVariantCaller component

This folder contains the following files: 

* The MPileupVariantCaller file is a template that specifies a workflow with 3 steps.

* The MPileupVariantCallerV1 file is a template that has a missing link with regards of MPileupVariantCaller. Used to test the MD5 encodings.

* The library-gen.owl file is a copy of http://www.wings-workflows.org/wings-omics-portal/export/users/ravali/genomics/components/library.owl, which is the library of components used in the workflow. In order to test the MD5 functionality of the components, the paths of the components have been altered to be local to the current machine. These are absolute paths, so if this is tested in another machine, these paths should be changed.
